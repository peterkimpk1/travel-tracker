# Travel Tracker

### Abstract
For this application, the user first lands on the login page that authenticates for a traveler's login. Upon logging in, a dashboard is displayed with user's pending/upcoming trips that has information on current/future trips and a summary of the total amount spent in the latest trip year. The past trips section uses Glide to show past visited destinations along with its information. "Book another trip" button opens a modal, featuring a slideshow of all destinations available for booking and the user can see the trip estimate based trip location, duration, and travelers. This application also has a separate login for the agency, where an agent can login to approve or deny user's pending trips, see a summary of the total amount the agency has made from users for the current year, and get a glimpse of all users who are on trips currently or will be in the future.
