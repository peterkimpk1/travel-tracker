# Travel Tracker

### Abstract
For this application, the user is first met with a login page that has basic authentication for a traveler's login. Upon logging in, a dashboard is displayed with user's pending/upcoming trips that has useful information on current/future trips and a summary of the total amount a user has spent in the latest trip year. The past trips section features a slideshow of past visited destinations along with its information. The user can interact with the "Book another trip" button to open a modal, that features a slideshow of all destinations available for booking and a way to see the trip estimate based on the user's selection of location, duration, and travelers. This application also has another login feature, where an agent can login to be greeted with an agency page. In the page, the agent can approve or deny user's trips, see a summary of the total amount the agency has made from users for the current year, and get a glimpse of all users who are currently or will be in trips.
